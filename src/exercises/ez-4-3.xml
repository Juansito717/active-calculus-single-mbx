        The velocity of an object moving along an axis is given by the piecewise linear function <m>v</m> that is pictured in <xref ref="F-4-3-Ez1">Figure</xref>.
        Assume that the object is moving to the right when its velocity is positive,
        and moving to the left when its velocity is negative.
        Assume that the given velocity function is valid for <m>t = 0</m> to <m>t = 4</m>.
