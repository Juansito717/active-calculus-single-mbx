    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>V(t) = 24 \cdot 1.07^t + 6 \sin(t)</m> represents the value of a person's investment portfolio in thousands of dollars in year <m>t</m>,
        where <m>t = 0</m> corresponds to January 1, 2010.
        <ol label="a.">
          <li>
            <p>
              At what instantaneous rate is the portfolio's value changing on January 1, 2012?

              Determine the value of <m>V''(2)</m>.
              What are the units on this quantity and what does it tell you about how the portfolio's value is changing?

          <li>
            <p>
              On the interval <m>0 \le t \le 20</m>,
              graph the function <m>V(t) = 24 \cdot 1.07^t + 6 \sin(t)</m> and describe its behavior in the context of the problem.
              Then, compare the graphs of the functions
              <m>A(t) = 24 \cdot 1.07^t</m> and <m>V(t) = 24 \cdot 1.07^t + 6 \sin(t)</m>,
              as well as the graphs of their derivatives <m>A'(t)</m> and <m>V'(t)</m>.
              What is the impact of the term

    <statement>

        Let <m>f(x) = 3\cos(x) - 2\sin(x) + 6</m>.
        <ol label="a.">
          <li>
            <p>
              Determine the exact slope of the tangent line to

            <p>
              At the point where <m>a = \frac{\pi}{2}</m>,

              does the tangent line to <m>y = f(x)</m> lie above the curve,
              below the curve, or neither?

    <statement>
      <p>
        In this exercise,
        we explore how the limit definition of the derivative more formally shows that <m>\frac{d}{dx}[\sin(x)] = \cos(x)</m>.
        Letting <m>f(x) = \sin(x)</m>,
        note that the limit definition of the derivative tells us that
        <me>
          f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sin(x+h) - \sin(x)}{h}
        </me>.
        <ol label="a.">
          <li>
            <p>
              Recall the trigonometric identity for the sine of a sum of angles <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m>:
              <m>\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta) + \cos(\alpha)\sin(\beta)</m>.
              Use this identity and some algebra to show that
              <me>
                f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)(\cos(h)-1) + \cos(x)\sin(h)}{h}
              </me>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Next, note that as <m>h</m> changes,
              <m>x</m> remains constant.
              Explain why it therefore makes sense to say that
              <me>
                f'(x) = \sin(x) \cdot \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\cos(h) -1 }{h} + \cos(x) \cdot \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sin(h)}{h}
              </me>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Finally,
              use small values of <m>h</m> to estimate the values of the two limits in (c):
              <me>
                \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\cos(h) - 1}{h} \ \ \text{and}  \ \ \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sin(h)}{h}
              </me>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              What do your results in (c) thus tell you about <m>f'(x)</m>?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              By emulating the steps taken above,
              use the limit definition of the derivative to argue convincingly that <m>\frac{d}{dx}[\cos(x)] = -\sin(x)</m>.
