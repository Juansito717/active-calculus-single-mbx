        Consider the curve given by the equation <m>2y^3+y^2-y^5 = x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2</m>.
        Find all points at which the tangent line to the curve is horizontal or vertical.
        Be sure to use a graphing utility to plot this implicit curve and to visually check the results of algebraic reasoning that you use to determine where the tangent lines are horizontal and vertical.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Implicit differentiation enables us a different perspective from which to see why the rule <m>\frac{d}{dx} [a^x] = a^x \ln(a)</m> holds,
        if we assume that <m>\frac{d}{dx}[\ln(x)] = \frac{1}{x}</m>.
        This exercise leads you through the key steps to do so.
        <ol label="a.">
          <li>
            <p>
              Let <m>y = a^x</m>.
              Rewrite this equation using the natural logarithm function to write <m>x</m> in terms of <m>y</m> (and the constant <m>a</m>).
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Differentiate both sides of the equation you found in (a) with respect to <m>x</m>,
              keeping in mind that <m>y</m> is implicitly a function of <m>x</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Solve the equation you found in (b) for <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>,
              and then use the definition of <m>y</m> to write
              <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> solely in terms of <m>x</m>.
              What have you found?
