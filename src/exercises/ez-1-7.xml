            <p>
              Based on the graph of <m>y = h'(x)</m>,

              At which values of <m>x</m> is <m>y = h'(x)</m> not defined?

              <m>y = h'(x)</m> that matches the provided graph at right.

              Investigate the value of <m>g'(0)</m> by estimating the limit in (b) using small positive and negative values of <m>h</m>.
              For instance,

              Be sure to use several different values of <m>h</m>
              (both positive and negative),
              including ones closer to 0 than 0.01.
              What do your results tell you about <m>g'(0)</m>?
