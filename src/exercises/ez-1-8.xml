<exercise>
<statement>
<p>
An object moving along a straight line path has a differentiable position function <m>y = s(t)</m>; <m>s(t)</m> measures the object's position relative to the origin at time <m>t</m>. It is known that at time <m>t = 9</m> seconds, the object's position is <m>s(9) = 4</m> feet (i.e., 4 feet to the right of the origin). Furthermore, the object's instantaneous velocity at <m>t = 9</m> is <m>-1.2</m> feet per second, and its acceleration at the same instant is <m>0.08</m> feet per second per second.
  <ol label="a.">
    <li><p>Use local linearity to estimate the position of the object at <m>t = 9.34</m>.</p></li>
    <li><p>Is your estimate likely too large or too small?  Why?</p></li>
    <li><p>In everyday language, describe the behavior of the moving object at <m>t = 9</m>.  Is it moving toward the origin or away from it? Is its velocity increasing or decreasing?</p></li>

For a certain function <m>f</m>, its derivative is known to be <m>f'(x) = (x-1)e^{-x^2}</m>. Note that you do not know a formula for <m>y = f(x)</m>.
  <ol label="a.">
    <li><p>At what <m>x</m>-value(s) is <m>f'(x) = 0</m>?  Justify your answer algebraically, but include a graph of <m>f'</m> to support your conclusion.</p></li>
    <li><p>Reasoning graphically, for what intervals of <m>x</m>-values is <m>f''(x) \gt 0</m>?  What does this tell you about the  behavior of the original function <m>f</m>?  Explain.</p></li>
    <li><p>Assuming that <m>f(2) = -3</m>, estimate the value of <m>f(1.88)</m> by finding and using the tangent line approximation to <m>f</m> at <m>x=2</m>.  Is your estimate larger or smaller than the true value of <m>f(1.88)</m>?  Justify your answer.</p></li>
