    <statement>
      <p>
        If a spherical tank of radius 4 feet has <m>h</m> feet of water present in the tank,
        then the volume of water in the tank is given by the formula
        <me>
          V = \frac{\pi}{3} h^2(12-h)
        </me>.
        <ol label="a.">
          <li>
            <p>
              At what instantaneous rate is the volume of water in the tank changing with respect to the <em>height</em>
              of the water at the instant <m>h = 1</m>?
              What are the units on this quantity?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Now suppose that the height of water in the tank is being regulated by an inflow and outflow (e.g., a faucet and a drain) so that the height of the water at time <m>t</m> is given by the rule <m>h(t) = \sin(\pi t) + 1</m>,
              where <m>t</m> is measured in hours (and <m>h</m> is still measured in feet).
              At what rate is the height of the water changing with respect to time at the instant <m>t = 2</m>?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Continuing under the assumptions in (b),
              at what instantaneous rate is the volume of water in the tank changing with respect to
              <em>time</em> at the instant <m>t = 2</m>?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              What are the main differences between the rates found in (a) and (c)?
              Include a discussion of the relevant units.
