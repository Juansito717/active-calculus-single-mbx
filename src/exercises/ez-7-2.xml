                By following the slope field so that we pass through the points <m>(0,-4)</m>, <m>(0,-3)</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>(0,4)</m>, we see the collection of curves in the figure above..

            <li>
              <p>
                It looks like the solution that passes through <m>(0,-1)</m> is a straight line with slope <m>m = 1</m>, and thus has the formula <m>y(t) = t-1</m>.  To verify this function is a solution, we compute both <m>\frac{dy}{dt}</m> and <m>t-y</m>.  Doing so, we see
                <me>
                  \frac{dy}{dt} = 1
                </me>
                and 
                <me>
                  t-y = t - (t-1) = 1 
                </me>.
                Thus, <m>y(t) = t-1</m> is indeed a solution to the differential equation.

            <li>
              <p>
                From both the differential equation and the graphs we have sketched,
                it appears that <m>t</m> and <m>y</m> are equal at any point where a solution has a local minimum.
                This is because when <m>t = y</m>, <m>\frac{dy}{dt} = t - y = 0</m>, and having the derivative be zero is required for any local minimum on a differentiable function.

              We first observe from the given plot of <m>\frac{dP}{dt}</m> versus <m>P</m> that <m>\frac{dP}{dt} = 0</m> when <m>P = 0</m>, <m>P = 1</m>, and <m>P = 3</m>.  Moreover, we see that <m>\frac{dP}{dt} \gt 0</m> when <m>P \lt 0</m> or <m>1 \lt P \lt 3</m>, and <m>\frac{dP}{dt} \lt 0</m> otherwise.  The closer <m>P</m> is to <m>0</m>, <m>1</m>, or <m>3</m>, the closer <m>\frac{dP}{dt}</m> is to <m>0</m>.  This leads us to sketch a direction field like the following.

          <li>
            <p>
              Following the slope field plotted above, we see that any solution curve that starts with <m>P(0) \gt 3</m> will decrease to <m>P(t) = 3</m> as <m>t \to \infty</m>.  Any curve that starts with <m>1 \lt P(0) \lt 3</m> will increase to <m>P(t) = 3</m>.  And any curve that starts with <m>0 \lt P(0) \lt 1</m> will decrease to <m>P(t) = 0</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The equilibrium solutions are the values of <m>P</m> where <m>\frac{dP}{dt} = 0</m>.  These are <m>P = 0</m>, <m>P = 1</m>, and <m>P = 3</m>.  The equilibrium solution <m>P = 1</m> is unstable, while the solutions <m>P = 0</m> and <m>P = 3</m> are stable.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>P(0) \gt 1</m>, the population's value will tend to <m>P(t) = 3</m> as <m>t \to \infty</m>; if <m>P(0) \lt 1</m>, the population's value will tend to <m>P(t) = 0</m>.  Thus, the population will stabilize either way, but either at the value <m>P = 3</m> or at a level that corresponds to the population going extinct.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              We can view <m>P(t) = 1</m> as the threshold for this population since if there aren't at least <m>P(t) = 1</m> members of the population, the population cannot grow.  This aligns well with the definition of the word threshold: <q>the magnitude or intensity that must be exceeded for a certain reaction, phenomenon, result, or condition to occur or be manifested</q>.
