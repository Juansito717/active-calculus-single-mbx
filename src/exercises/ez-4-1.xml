        Along the eastern shore of Lake Michigan from Lake Macatawa
        (near Holland)
        to Grand Haven,
        there is a bike bath that runs almost directly north-south.
        For the purposes of this problem,
        assume the road is completely straight,
        and that the function <m>s(t)</m> tracks the position of the biker along this path in miles north of Pigeon Lake,
        which lies roughly halfway between the ends of the bike path.
      </p>

      <p>
        Suppose that the biker's velocity function is given by the graph in <xref ref="F-4-1-Ez1">Figure</xref>
        on the time interval <m>0 \le t \le 4</m>
        (where <m>t</m> is measured in hours),
        and that <m>s(0) = 1</m>.

        The rocket's vertical velocity at time <m>t</m>

        Filters at a water treatment plant become dirtier over time and thus become less effective;
        they are replaced every 30 days.
        During one 30-day period,
        the rate at which pollution passes through the filters into a nearby lake
        (in units of particulate matter per day)
        is measured every 6 days and is given in the following table.
        The time <m>t</m> is measured in days since the filters were replaced.
