  <statement>
    <p>
      Suppose you have a bank account that grows by 5<percent /> every year.
      Let <m>A(t)</m> be the amount of money in the account in year <m>t</m>.
      <ol label="a.">
        <li>
          <p>
            What is the rate of change of <m>A</m> with respect to <m>t</m>?
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Suppose that you are also withdrawing <dollar />10,000 per year.
            Write a differential equation that expresses the total rate of change of <m>A</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Sketch a slope field for this differential equation,
            find any equilibrium solutions,
            and identify them as either stable or unstable.
            Write a sentence or two that describes the significance of the stability of the equilibrium solution.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Suppose that you initially deposit <dollar />100,000 into the account.
            How long does it take for you to deplete the account?
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            What is the smallest amount of money you would need to have in the account to guarantee that you never deplete the money in the account?
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            If your initial deposit is <dollar />300,000,
            how much could you withdraw every year without depleting the account?
