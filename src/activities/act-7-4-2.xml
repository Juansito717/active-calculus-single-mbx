  <statement>
    <p>
      Suppose that a cup of coffee is initially at a temperature of
      <m>105^\circ</m> F and is placed in a <m>75^\circ</m> F room.
      Newton's law of
      cooling says that
      <me>
        \frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T-75)
      </me>,
      where <m>k</m> is a constant of proportionality.

            Suppose you measure that the coffee is cooling at one degree per minute at the time the coffee is brought into the room.
            Use the differential equation to determine the value of the constant <m>k</m>.
