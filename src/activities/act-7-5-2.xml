  <statement>
    <p>
      A dose of morphine is
      absorbed from the bloodstream of a patient at a rate
      proportional to the amount in the bloodstream.
      <ol label="a.">
        <li>
          <p>
            Write a differential equation for <m>M(t)</m>,
            the amount of morphine in the patient's bloodstream,
            using <m>k</m> as the constant proportionality.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Assuming that the initial dose of morphine is <m>M_0</m>,
            solve the initial value problem to find <m>M(t)</m>.
            Use the fact that the half-life for the absorption of morphine is two hours to find the constant <m>k</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Suppose that a patient is given morphine intravenously at the rate of 3 milligrams per hour.
            Write a differential equation that combines the intravenous administration of morphine with the body's natural absorption.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Find any equilibrium solutions and determine their stability.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Assuming that there is initially no morphine in the patient's bloodstream,
            solve the initial value problem to determine <m>M(t)</m>.
            What happens to <m>M(t)</m> after a very long time?
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            To what rate should a doctor reduce the intravenous rate so that there is eventually 7 milligrams of morphine in the patient's bloodstream?
