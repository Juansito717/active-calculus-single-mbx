  <statement>
    <p>
      Suppose that the population of a town is growing continuously at an annual rate of 3<percent /> per year.
      <ol label="a.">
        <li>
          <p>
            Let <m>P(t)</m> be the population of the town in year <m>t</m>.
            Write a differential equation that describes the annual growth rate.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Find the solutions of this differential equation.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            If you know that the town's population in year 0 is 10,000,
            find the population <m>P(t)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            How long does it take for the population to double?
            This time is called the <em>doubling time</em>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Working more generally,
            find the doubling time if the annual growth rate is <m>k</m> times the population.
