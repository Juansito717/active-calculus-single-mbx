      Our first model will be based on the following assumption:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <em>The rate of change of the population is proportional to the population. </em>
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      On the face of it, this seems pretty reasonable.
      When there is a relatively small number of people,
      there will be fewer births and deaths so the rate of change will be small.
      When there is a larger number of people,
      there will be more births and deaths so we expect a larger rate of change.
    </p>

    <p>
      If <m>P(t)</m> is the population <m>t</m> years after the year 2000, we may
      express this assumption as
      <me>
        \frac{dP}{dt} = kP
      </me>
      where <m>k</m> is a constant of proportionality.
      <ol label="a.">
        <li>
          <p>
            Use the data in the table to estimate the derivative <m>P'(0)</m> using a central difference.
            Assume that <m>t=0</m> corresponds to the year 2000.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            What is the population <m>P(0)</m>?
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Use these two facts to estimate the constant of proportionality <m>k</m> in the differential equation.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Now that we know the value of <m>k</m>, we have the initial
            value problem
            <me>
              \frac{dP}{dt} = kP, \ P(0) = 6.084
            </me>.
            Find the solution to this initial value problem.

        <li>
          <p>
            What does your solution predict for the population in the year 2010?
            Is this close to the actual population given in the table?
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            When does your solution predict that the population will reach 12 billion?
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            What does your solution predict for the population in the year 2500?
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            Do you think this is a reasonable model for the earth's population?
            Why or why not?
            Explain your thinking using a couple of complete sentences.
