        <p>
            Calculus can be viewed broadly as the study of change.
            A natural and important question to ask about any changing quantity is
            <q>how fast is the quantity changing?</q>
            It turns out that in order to make the answer to this question precise,
            substantial mathematics is required.

        <title>Position and average velocity</title>
        <p>
            Any moving object has a <em>position</em>
            <idx><h>position</h></idx>
            that can be considered a function of <em>time</em>.
            When this motion is along a straight line,
            the position is given by a single variable,
            and we usually let this position be denoted by <m>s(t)</m>,
            which reflects the fact that position is a function of time.
            For example,
            we might view <m>s(t)</m> as telling the mile marker of a car traveling on a straight highway at time <m>t</m> in hours;
            similarly, the function <m>s</m> described in <xref ref="PA-1-1">Preview Activity</xref> is a position function,
            where position is measured vertically relative to the ground.
        </p>

        <p>
            Not only does such a moving object have a position associated with its motion,
            but on any time interval, the object has an
            <em>average velocity</em>.
            Think, for example, about driving from one location to another:
            the vehicle travels some number of miles over a certain time interval
            (measured in hours),
            from which we can compute the vehicle's average velocity.
            In this situation,
            average velocity is the number of miles traveled divided by the time elapsed,
            which of course is given in <em>miles per hour</em>.
            Similarly, the calculation of
            <m>AV_{[0.5,1]}</m> in <xref ref="PA-1-1">Preview Activity</xref>
            found the average velocity of the ball on the time interval <m>[0.5,1]</m>,
            measured in feet per second.
        </p>

        <p>
            In general, we make the following definition:
            for an object moving in a straight line whose position at time <m>t</m> is given by the function <m>s(t)</m>, the
            <idx><h>average velocity</h></idx>
            <em>average velocity of the object on the interval from <m>t = a</m> to <m>t = b</m></em>,
            denoted <m>AV_{[a,b]}</m>, is given by the formula
            <me>
                AV_{[a,b]} = \frac{s(b)-s(a)}{b-a}
                </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note well: the units on <m>AV_{[a,b]}</m> are
            <q>units of <m>s</m> per unit of <m>t</m>,</q>
            such as <q>miles per hour</q> or <q>feet per second.</q>
