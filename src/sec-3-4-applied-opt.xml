  <title>Applied Optimization</title>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          In a setting where a situation is described for which optimal parameters are sought,
          how do we develop a function that models the situation and use calculus to find the desired maximum or minimum?
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </objectives>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Near the conclusion of <xref ref="sec-3-3-optimization">Section</xref>,
      we considered two optimization problems where determining the function to be optimized was part of the problem.
      In <xref ref="Ex-3-3-1">Example</xref>,
      we sought to use a single piece of wire to build an equilateral triangle and square
      in order to maximize the total combined area enclosed.
      In the subsequent <xref ref="act-3-3-3">Activity</xref>,
      we investigated how the volume of a box constructed from a piece of cardboard by removing squares from each corner and folding up the sides depends on the size of the squares removed.
    </p>

    <p>
      In neither of these problems exemplify situations was a function to optimize explicitly provided.
      Rather, we first tried to understand the problem by
      drawing a figure and introducing variables,
      and then sought to develop a formula for a function that modeled the quantity
      to be optimized.
      Once the function was established,
      we then considered what domain was appropriate.
      At that point,
      we were finally ready to apply the ideas of calculus to determine the absolute minimum or maximum.
          </p>

    <p>
      Throughout what follows in the current section,
      the primary emphasis is on the reader solving problems.
      Initially, some substantial guidance is provided,
      with the problems progressing to require greater independence as we move along.

  <subsection>
    <title>More applied optimization problems</title>
    <p>
     The steps in <xref ref="PA-3-4">Preview Activity</xref>
      apply to any applied optimization problem.
      We briefly summarize those here to provide an overview of our approach.

      <note>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Draw a picture and introduce variables.
                We must first understand what quantities are allowed to vary in the problem and then represent those values with variables.
                Sketching a figure with the variables labeled is a good first step.
                Sometimes drawing several diagrams can be especially helpful.
                A nice example of this can be seen at <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/99">http://gvsu.edu/s/99</url>,
                where the choice of where to bend a piece of wire into the shape of a rectangle determines both the rectangle's shape and area.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Identify the quantity to be optimized and any relationships among the variable quantities.
                Write equations about the variables:
                one to represent the quantity whose minimum or maximum is sought,
                and possibly others that show how the variables in the problem may be interrelated.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Determine a function of a single variable that models the quantity to be optimized.
                This may involve using other relationships among variables to eliminate one or more variables in the function formula.
                For example, in <xref ref="PA-3-4">Preview Activity</xref>,
                we initially found that <m>V = x^2 y</m>,
                but the additional relationship that <m>4x + y = 108</m>
                (girth plus length equals 108 inches)
                allowed us to eliminate <m>y</m> and write the volume as a function of the single variable, <m>V(x) = x^2(108-4x)</m>.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Decide the domain on which to consider the function being optimized.
                Often the physical constraints of the problem will limit the possible values for the independent variable.
                Thinking back to the diagram describing the overall situation and any relationships among variables in the problem often helps identify the smallest and largest values of the input variable.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Use calculus to identify the absolute maximum and/or minimum of the quantity being optimized.
                Find the critical numbers of the function first.
                If the domain is an open or unbounded interval
                we construct a first derivative sign chart,
                or, for a closed, bounded interval, we evaluate the function at the endpoints and critical numbers.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Finally, we make certain we have answered the question:
                do we seek the absolute maximum of a quantity,
                or the values of the variables that produce the maximum?
                That is,
          finding the absolute maximum volume of a parcel is different from finding the dimensions of the parcel that produce the maximum.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </note>

    <p>
      Familiarity with common geometric formulas is particularly helpful in problems such as the one in <xref ref="act-3-4-1">Activity</xref>.
      Sometimes those involve perimeter,
      area, volume, or surface area.
      At other times,
      the constraints of a problem introduce right triangles
      (where the Pythagorean Theorem applies)
      or other functions whose formulas provide relationships among the variables.
    </p>

    <xi:include href="./activities/act-3-4-2.xml" />

    <p>
      In more geometric problems,
      we often use curves or functions to provide natural constraints.
      For instance,
      we could investigate which isosceles triangle that circumscribes a unit circle has the smallest area,
      which you can explore for yourself at <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/9b">http://gvsu.edu/s/9b</url>.
      Or similarly, for a region bounded by a parabola,
      we might seek the rectangle of largest area that fits beneath the curve,
      as shown at <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/9c">http://gvsu.edu/s/9c</url>.
      The next activity is similar to the latter problem.

          <p>
            While there is no single algorithm that works in every situation where optimization is used,
            in most of the problems we consider,
            the following steps are helpful:
            draw a picture and introduce variables;
            identify the quantity to be optimized and find relationships among the variables;
            determine a function of a single variable that models the quantity to be optimized;
            decide the domain on which to consider the function being optimized;
            use calculus to identify the absolute maximum and/or minimum of the quantity being optimized.
