  <statement>
    <p>
      In this activity we will determine the Taylor series expansion for <m>\arctan(x)</m>, plus we'll explore a different way to find the Taylor series for <m>\ln(1+x)</m>.

        <li>
          <p>
            We begin with the function <m>g(x) = \arctan(x)</m>.

            <li>
              <p>
                What is <m>g'(x)</m>?

              <p>
                Recall that in <xref ref="PA-8a-5">Preview Activity</xref>, we found the Taylor series expansion for 
                <me>
                  f(x) = \frac{1}{1+x^2}
                </me>.
                State the Taylor series for <m>f(x)</m> that you found in the preview activity.

            <li>
              <p>
                What is the important relationship between <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{1+x^2}</m> and <m>g(x) = \arctan(x)</m>?  Use this relationship to find a power series expansion for <m>g(x)</m>.  (Note: we know that <m>g(0) = \arctan(0) = 0</m>, we we can use this fact to help us determine the constant <m>C</m> that arises.)

              <p>
                For what interval of <m>x</m>-values is the Taylor series for <m>g(x) = \arctan(x)</m> guaranteed to converge?

            In <xref ref="sec-8a-4-taylor-series">Section</xref>, we used <xref ref="D-8a-4-Taylor-series">Definition</xref> to find the Taylor series expansion for <m>h(x) = \ln(1+x)</m>.  Here we use substitution and integration to develop the Taylor series of <m>h(x)</m> in a different way.

                Let <m>u = -x</m> and use the series in (i) to find the Taylor series expansion for <m>r(x) = \frac{1}{1+x}</m>.

                Use this result along with the fact that <m>r(0) = \ln(1) = 0</m> to find the Taylor series for <m>h(x) = \ln(1+x)</m>.
