  <statement>
    <p>
      We have established that for <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}</m>, the degree <m>n</m> Taylor polynomial approximation centered at <m>a = 0</m> is
      <me>
        T_n(x) = 1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^n
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <ol marker="a.">
        <li>
          <p>
            Determine the exact value (as a fraction) of <m>T_1\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)</m>, <m>T_2\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)</m>, <m>T_3\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)</m>, and <m>T_4\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)</m>.  How does each compare to the exact value of <m>f\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)</m>?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Explain why <m>T_n\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)</m> is a finite geometric series by identifying <m>a</m> and <m>r</m>, and then use <xref ref="eq-8a-3-part-sum-geometric">Equation</xref> to find a single fraction that represents the sum given by <m>T_n\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Now think more generally and explain why <m>T_n\left( x \right)</m> is a finite geometric series by identifying <m>a</m> and <m>r</m>, and then use <xref ref="eq-8a-3-part-sum-geometric">Equation</xref> to find a single fraction that represents the sum given by <m>T_n\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)</m>.  
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If we let the Taylor polynomial <m>T_n(x) = 1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^n</m> continue indefinitely, we get what we will call a <term>Taylor series</term>.  Here we let
            <me>
              T(x) = 1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^n + \cdots
            </me>.
            Explain why this infinite series is geometric, identify <m>a</m> and <m>r</m>, and use <xref ref="eq-8a-3-infinite-geometric-sum">Equation</xref> to find the sum of the series as a function of <m>x</m> that is expressed as a single fraction.  For which values of <m>x</m> is this sum valid?  What do you notice about this expression for <m>T(x)</m>?
          </p>  
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            What is the domain of the function <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}</m>?  How is this connected to your work in (d)?
