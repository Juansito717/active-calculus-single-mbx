		<p>
			We continue to work with <m>f(x)=e^x</m> and the four approximations of degree <m>1</m>, <m>2</m>, <m>3</m>, and <m>4</m> given by <m>L(x)</m>, <m>Q(x)</m>, <m>T(x)</m>, and <m>S(x)</m>.

		      <li>
		        <p>
		          In <xref ref="PA-8a-1">Preview Activity</xref>, we built a spreadsheet that computed the differences between <m>f(x)</m> and <m>L(x)</m> for <m>x</m>-values between <m>-1</m> and <m>1</m>, spaced <m>0.1</m> units apart.  Your spreadsheet started like the one shown in <xref ref="T-8a-1-PA-linear-approx">Table</xref>.
		        </p>	
		        
		        <p>
		        	Next, we build an updated version of this spreadsheet that computes similar differences between <m>f</m> and the three higher degree approximations we have found.  In particular, we now want to have columns for <m>\Delta x</m>, <m>x</m>, <m>f(x)</m>, <m>L(x)</m>, <m>Q(x)</m>, <m>T(x)</m>, and <m>S(x)</m>, plus the absolute differences <m>|f(x) - L(x)</m>, <m>|f(x) - Q(x)</m>, <m>|f(x) - T(x)</m>, and <m>|f(x) - S(x)</m>.  (<alert>Hint:</alert> when building your entries, note that you can think of <m>Q(x)</m> as <m>Q(x) = L(x) + \frac{1}{2}x^2</m>, and similarly view <m>T(x)</m> as <q><m>Q(x)</m> plus one more term</q>.) Include at least <m>5</m> digits of accuracy beyond the decimal.  Your spreadsheet might start like this:		
		          <table xml:id="T-8a-act-3-approx">
		            <title>Comparing <m>f(x) = e^x</m> and its degree <m>1</m>, <m>2</m>, <m>3</m>, <m>4</m> approximations near <m>a = 0</m>.</title>
