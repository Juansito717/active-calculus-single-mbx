  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>f(x) = e^x</m>.  Our goal is to understand why the Taylor series for <m>f(x)</m> converges for every real number <m>x</m> and see that the Taylor series converges to <m>e^x</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <ol marker="a.">
        <li>
          <p>
            For <m>f(x) = e^x</m>, explain why <m>f^{(k)}(0) = 1</m> for every natural number <m>k</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            State the Taylor series, <m>T_f(x)</m> centered at <m>a = 0</m> for <m>f(x) = e^x</m>.  Write <m>T_f(x)</m> in both sigma notation and as an expanded sum.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Let <m>r_n(x)</m> be the ratio of the <m>(n+1)</m>st term to the <m>n</m>th term of <m>T_f(x)</m>.  Find the simplest expression you can for <m>r_n(x)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Let <m>r(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} r_n(x)</m>.  Evaluate this limit, and then apply the Ratio Test to say what you can conclude about the <m>x</m>-values for which <m>T_f(x)</m> converges.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Use a computational device to graph <m>f(x) = e^x</m>, <m>T_{10}(x)</m>, and <m>T_{20}(x)</m> on the same axes.  What do you observe?
