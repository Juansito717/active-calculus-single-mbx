  <statement>
    <p>
      In this activity we will determine the Taylor series expansion for the famous <em>error function</em>,
      <me>
        \erf(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_0^x e^{-t^2} \, dt
      </me>.
    </p>


    <p>
      <ol marker="a.">
        <li>
          <p>
            Use the Taylor series for <m>e^{x}</m> to find the Taylor series for <m>e^{-t^2}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Next, evaluate the integral <m>\int_0^x e^{-t^2} \, dt</m> by replacing <m>e^{-t^2}</m> with its Taylor series.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Use your work in (b) to state the Taylor series for <m>\erf(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_0^x e^{-t^2} \, dt</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            For what interval of <m>x</m>-values will the Taylor series for <m>\erf(x)</m> converge?  Why?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In probability theory, <m>\erf(x)</m> is important because of its connection to the <em>normal distribution</em>, which is represented by a bell curve.  Indeed, <m>\erf(x)</m> represents the fraction of a normally distributed characteristic in a population that lies between <m>0</m> and <m>x</m>.  How can you use your result in (c) to estimate <m>\erf(2)</m>?
