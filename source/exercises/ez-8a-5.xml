    <statement>
      <p>
        In this exercise we find the Taylor series representation for two famous functions, the error function 
        <me>
          erf(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_0^x e^{-t^2} \, dt
        </me>
        and the Fresnel integral function
        <me>
          Ci(x) = \int_0^x \cos(t^2) \, dt
        </me>.
        The error function describes the probability that a measurement differs from the actual value by a certain amount, and the Fresnel integral function is important in optics and is used in the design of Fresnel lenses such as those found in lighthouses along the Lake Michigan shore.

          Taylor series also provide an alternate way to evaluate indeterminate limits.
        </p>

        <ol marker="a.">
          <li>
            <p>
              Find the Taylor series for <m>\sin(2t)</m> and use it to evaluate 
              <me>
                \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\sin(2t)}{t}
              </me>.
              Compare your result to what follows from L'Hôpital's Rule (see <xref ref="sec-2-8-LHR">Section</xref> as needed).

          <li>
            <p>
              Consider the indeterminate limit given by
              <me>
                \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^x - 1 - x}{\cos(2x)-1}
              </me>.
              Find the Taylor series representations for <m>f(x) = e^x - 1 - x</m> and <m>g(x) = \cos(2x)-1</m> and use them to evaluate the given limit.  How does your result compare to using L'Hôpital's Rule?
