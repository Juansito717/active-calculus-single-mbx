  <introduction>
    <p>
      In our work in <xref ref="sec-8a-2-taylor-poly">Section</xref>, we learned how to find a degree <m>n</m> polynomial approximation centered at a value <m>a</m> for a given function <m>f</m> with at least <m>n</m> derivatives.  By working with several different functions and <m>n</m>-values, we've seen that increasing the degree of the polynomial improves the approximation, and also often helps us to see a pattern in the coefficients of the Taylor polynomials.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, the degree <m>5</m> Taylor approximation of <m>f(x) = \ln(1+x)</m> at <m>a = 0</m> is
          <me>
            T_5(x) = 1x - \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{1}{4}x^4 + \frac{1}{5}x^5,
          </me>
      and we see a pattern in the coefficients that allows us to easily generate <m>T_6(x)</m>, <m>T_{10}(x)</m>, or indeed <m>T_n(x)</m> for any <m>n</m>.  Note that if we want to use <m>T_{10}(x)</m> to estimate <m>\ln(\frac{1}{2})</m>, we need to compute the sum of <m>10</m> terms given by
          <me>
            \ln\left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \approx T_{10}\left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = 1 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 - \frac{1}{4} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^4 + \cdots - \frac{1}{10} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{10}.  
          </me>
      This computation suggests at least two questions:  is there an easy way (without a computer) to determine the value of the <m>10</m>-term sum 
      <me>1 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 - \frac{1}{4} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^4 + \cdots - \frac{1}{10} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{10}?</me> and, is there a way we can make sense of continuing the sum indefinitely, <me>1 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 - \frac{1}{4} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^4 + \cdots - \frac{1}{10} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{10} + \cdots?</me>
    </p>

    <p>
      In this section, we investigate a special collection of similar sums that are called <term>geometric</term> sums.

  <subsection>
    <title>Finite Geometric Sums</title>
    <p>
      Sums such as 
      <me>
        1 + \frac{1}{2} + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 + \cdots + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{n-1}
      </me>,
      <me>
        1 + \frac{1}{4} + \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^3 + \cdots + \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^{n-1}
      </me>,
      and 
      <me>
        2 - \frac{4}{3} + \frac{8}{9} - \frac{16}{27} + \cdots + 2 \cdot \left( \frac{-2}{3} \right)^{n-1}
      </me>
      all share a similar structure:  the next term in each sum is found by multiplying the last term by the same number.  In the first sum, each subsequent term is found by multiplying by <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>; in the second sum, by multiplying by <m>\frac{1}{4}</m>; and in the third sum, the multiplier is <m>-\frac{2}{3}</m>.
      These sums each have the form
      <men xml:id="eq-8-3a-finite-geometric-1">
        a+ar+ar^2+ \cdots + ar^{n-1}
      </men>,
      which we call a <term>finite geometric series</term>
<!--          <idx><h>finite geometric series</h></idx> -->
      with ratio <m>r</m>.  It turns out that each sum that has this form can be computed quickly without having to add all of the individual terms.
    </p>

    <xi:include href="./activities/act-8a-3-1.xml" />

    <p>
      The ideas in <xref ref="act-8a-3-1">Activity</xref> can be extended to the general case for any value of <m>a</m> and any value of <m>r \ne 1</m>.  In particular, replacing <m>1</m> with <m>a</m> and <m>\frac{2}{5}</m> with <m>r</m>, our work shows that by finding <m>r \cdot S_n</m> and then subtracting that quantity from <m>S_n</m>, we get 
      <me>
        S_n - rS_n = (a + ar + \cdots + ar^{n-1}) - (ar + ar^2 + \cdots + ar^n)
      </me>,
      so that
      <me>
        S_n(1-r) = a - ar^n
      </me>,
      and therefore
      <me>
        S_n = \frac{a - ar^n}{1-r}
      </me>.
      We summarize this result formally as follows.

      <title>Summing a finite geometric series</title>

        A finite geometric series <m>S_n</m> is a sum of the form

        The value of the finite geometric series <m>S_n</m> can be computed directly as

  <subsection>
    <title>Infinite Geometric Sums</title>

    <p>
      Our initial introduction to sums with many terms came from Taylor polynomial approximations such as 
      <me>
        e^1 \approx T_5(1) = 1 + 1 + \frac{1}{2!} + \frac{1}{3!} + \frac{1}{4!} + \frac{1}{5!}      
      </me>.
      Because the approximation gets better as we add more terms, it's natural to wonder if it's possible to think about the sum extending forever.  Indeed, we can ask the same question for a finite geometric series such as 
      <me>
        S_n = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 + \cdots + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{n-1}
      </me>:
      what happens if we let the sum continue indefinitely?
    </p>

    <example xml:id="Ex-8a-3-inf-geom-1">
      <title>An infinite geometric series</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Can we find the value of 
        <me>
          1 + \frac{1}{2} + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 + \cdots
        </me>, 
        where the sum never terminates?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          In <xref ref="PA-8a-3">Preview Activity</xref>, we saw that for the finite geometric series
          <me>
            S_n = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 + \cdots + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{n-1}
          </me>,
          <m>S_1 = 1</m>, <m>S_2 = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5</m>, <m>S_3 = \frac{7}{4} = 1.75</m>, <m>S_4 = \frac{15}{8} = 1.875</m>, <m>S_5 = \frac{31}{16} = 1.9375</m>, and indeed
          <me>
            S_n = \frac{1 - \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} 
          </me>
          so if we multiply both the numerator and denominator by <m>2^n</m>, we find that
          <men xml:id="eq-8a-3-Sn-one-half-closed">
            S_n = \frac{2^n - 1}{2^{n-1}}
          </men>.
          Plotting these partial sums on a number line, we see evidence that the value of the <m>n</m>th partial sum is approaching <m>2</m>.
        </p>  

    <figure xml:id="F-8a-3-geom-half">
      <caption>A plot of <m>S_1</m>, <m>S_2</m>, <m>S_3</m>, <m>S_4</m>, <m>S_5</m>, and the number <m>2</m> on the interval <m>[1,2]</m>.</caption>
      <image width="80%" source="images/8a_3_geom_half" />
    </figure>

        <p>
          Indeed, we observe that each partial sum lies halfway between the preceding partial sum and the number <m>2</m>:  <m>S_2 = 1.5</m> is halfway between <m>S_1 = 1</m> and <m>2</m>; <m>S_3 = 1.75</m> is halfway between <m>S_2 = 1.5</m> and <m>2</m>; and so on. 
        </p>

        <p>
          We can see this more formally in <xref ref="eq-8a-3-Sn-one-half-closed">Equation</xref> if we divide the two terms in the numerator of <m>S_n</m> by the denominator.  Doing so, an equivalent formula for <m>S_n</m> is 
          <men xml:id="eq-8a-3-Sn-one-half">
            S_n = 2 - \frac{1}{2^{n-1}}
          </men>.
          In <xref ref="eq-8a-3-Sn-one-half">Equation</xref>, if we let <m>n \to \infty</m>, we have 
          <me>
            \lim_{n \to \infty} S_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left( 2 - \frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \right) = 2
          </me>,
          since <m>\frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \to 0</m> as <m>n</m> increases without bound.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus, it makes sense to say that the sum of the infinite geometric series 
          <me>
            S = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 + \cdots
          </me>
          is finite and that <m>S = 2</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      <xref ref="Ex-8a-3-inf-geom-1">Example</xref> demonstrates the general principle that we use to determine if any infinite series has a finite sum:  we consider the <term>partial sum</term>, <m>S_n</m>, which is the finite sum of the first <m>n</m> terms, and then investigate if the partial sums converge to a single value as <m>n</m> increases without bound.  For geometric series, determining whether the partial sums converge or not is straightforward.
    </p>

    <assemblage>
      <title>Summing an infinite geometric series</title>
      <p>
        An infinite geometric series <m>S</m> is a sum of the form
        <men xml:id="eq-8a-3-geometric-series-infinite">
          S = a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots + ar^{n-1} + \cdots
        </men>,
        where <m>a</m> and <m>r</m> are real numbers.
        If <m>|r| \lt 1</m>, then the infinite geometric series converges to a finite sum whose value is
        <men xml:id="eq-8a-3-infinite-geometric-sum">
          S = \frac{a}{1-r}
        </men>.
        If <m>|r| \ge 1</m>, then the infinite geometric series does not converge to a finite sum.
      </p>
    </assemblage>   

    <p>
      <xref ref="eq-8a-3-infinite-geometric-sum">Equation</xref> holds because when <m>|r| \lt 1</m>, it follows that <m>r^n \to 0</m> as <m>n \to \infty</m>.  Indeed, when <m>|r| \lt 1</m>, we see by taking the limit as <m>n \to \infty</m> in <xref ref="eq-8a-3-geometric-series-finite">Equation</xref>, that
      <me>
        \lim_{n \to \infty} S_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r} = \frac{a}{1-r}
      </me>.
      In <xref ref="ez-8a-3-1">Exercise</xref>, we will explore why the infinite geometric series does not converge when <m>|r| = 1</m> and when <m>|r| \gt 1</m>.
    </p> 

    <p>
      As in our work in <xref ref="C-4">Chapter</xref> with Riemann sums, we can use sigma notation (see <xref ref="sigma-notation">Subsection</xref>) to express a sum in convenient shorthand.  For instance, it's equivalent to write
      <me>
        S_n = a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots + ar^{n-1} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ar^k 
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Furthermore, we can use sigma notation for a more concise way to express an infinite geometric series.  For example, it is equivalent to write 
      <me>
        1 + \frac{1}{2} + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 + \cdots = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^k

  <subsection>
    <title>How geometric sums naturally connect to Taylor polynomials</title>

    <p>
      If we take <m>a = 1</m> in <xref ref="eq-8a-3-infinite-geometric-sum">Equation</xref>, we see that
      <me>
        1 + r + r^2 + \cdots + r^n + \cdots = \frac{1}{1-r}
      </me>,
      provided that <m>|r| \lt 1</m>.  To study this equation further, we are going to let <m>r</m> vary and thus we introduce the function <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}</m> and replace <m>r</m> by <m>x</m> in the preceding equation to have
      <men xml:id="eq-8a-3-geom-taylor">
        f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x} = 1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^n + \cdots
      </men>,
      which is valid for <m>|x| \lt 1</m>.  One reason this equation is interesting is that we have a function <m>f(x)</m> that can be represented in two different ways:  as the rational function <m>\frac{1}{1-x}</m>, and as the infinite polynomial function <m>1 + x + x^2 + \cdots</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      For <m>x</m> such that <m>|x| \lt 1</m>, we know that <m>x^n \to 0</m>, plus we know that for such <m>x</m>, the infinite sum <m>1 + x+ x^2 + \cdots + x^n + \cdots</m> is finite.  Thus, from <xref ref="eq-8a-3-geom-taylor">Equation</xref>, it follows 
      <me>
        f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x} \approx 1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^n

      Moreover, because the infinite sum convergest, the larger the value of <m>n</m>, the better the approximation will be.  If we plot the function <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}</m> along with several of the polynomials that arise for different choices of <m>n</m>, say <m>P_1(x) = 1 + x</m>, <m>P_4(x) = 1 + x + \cdots + x^4</m>, and <m>P_7(x) = 1 + x + \cdots + x^7</m>, we see this occur in <xref ref="F-8a-3-geom-x">Figure</xref>.

      In particular, we observe that as the degree of the polynomial approximation increases, the polynomial appears closer to <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}</m> and does so on a wider interval of <m>x</m>-values.  Since the infinite sum only converges when <m>|x| \lt 1</m> and the function <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}</m> is undefined when <m>x = 1</m>, we also expect the approximations to only be accurate on an interval that lies within <m>-1 \lt x \lt 1</m>.  This reminds of our earlier work with Taylor polynomials where in images such as <xref ref="F-8a-2-log-example">Figure</xref>, increasing the degree of the Taylor polynomial similarly improves the approximation.

      In our preceding work in this section, we arrived at the function <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}</m> by starting with the infinite geometric sum

        1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^n + \cdots
      </me>
      and exploring its partial sums.  Next, we change perspective and start with function <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}</m> and determine the Taylor polynomial approximations to <m>f</m> that are centered at <m>a = 0</m> in order to see an interesting connection.
