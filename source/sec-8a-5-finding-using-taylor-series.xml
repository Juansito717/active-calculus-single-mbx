  <introduction>
    <p>
      So far, we have focused our attention on a small collection of basic functions functions <mdash><m>\frac{1}{1-x}</m>, <m>\ln(1+x)</m>, <m>\sin(x)</m>, <m>\cos(x)</m>, and <m>e^x</m></mdash> and their Taylor series centered at <m>a = 0</m>.  One of the reasons we were able to find these Taylor series is that clear patterns arise in the derivatives of each of these functions.  While we can always use <xref ref="D-8a-4-Taylor-series">Definition</xref> to find the first few terms of a Taylor series, finding a pattern among the various derivatives is challenging for most functions.  In <xref ref="PA-8a-5">Preview Activity</xref>, we explore this issue and investigate a different approach to finding the Taylor series of the function.

  <subsection>
    <title>Using substitution and algebra to find new Taylor series expressions</title>
    <p>
      The substitution technique we used in <xref ref="PA-8a-5">Preview Activity</xref> can be used to find the Taylor series for any function whose structure is similar to that of a Taylor series we already know.  For instance, since 
      <me>
        f(x) = \cos(x) = 1 - \frac{1}{2!}x^2 + \frac{1}{4!}x^4 - \cdots + (-1)^n \frac{1}{(2n)!} x^{2n} + \cdots
      </me>
      for all <m>x</m>, we can change variables and view this equation as saying
      <men xml:id="eq-8a-5-cosu">
        f(u) = \cos(u) = 1 - \frac{1}{2!}u^2 + \frac{1}{4!}u^4 - \cdots + (-1)^n \frac{1}{(2n)!} u^{2n} + \cdots
      </men>
      for all <m>u</m>.  If we then wanted to find the Taylor series expansion for <m>g(x) = x^4 \cdot \cos(x^3)</m>, we could do so using the following process.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, by letting <m>u = x^3</m>, we see that <xref ref="eq-8a-5-cosu">Equation</xref> implies
      <me>
        \cos(x^3) = 1 - \frac{1}{2!}(x^3)^2 + \frac{1}{4!}(x^3)^4 - \cdots + (-1)^n \frac{1}{(2n)!} (x^3)^{2n} + \cdots
      </me>, 
      or
      <men xml:id="eq-8a-5-cosx3">
        \cos(x^3) = 1 - \frac{1}{2!}x^6 + \frac{1}{4!}x^{12} - \cdots + (-1)^n \frac{1}{(2n)!} x^{6n} + \cdots
      </men>.      
      Then, multiplying both sides of <xref ref="eq-8a-5-cosx3">Equation</xref> by <m>x^4</m>, we find that 
      <me>
        g(x) = x^4 \cos(x^3) = x^4 - \frac{1}{2!}x^{10} + \frac{1}{4!}x^{16} - \cdots + (-1)^n \frac{1}{(2n)!} x^{6n+4} + \cdots
      </me>.
      Since <xref ref="eq-8a-5-cosu">Equation</xref> is valid for every real number <m>u</m>, letting <m>u = x^3</m> tells us that <xref ref="eq-8a-5-cosx3">Equation</xref> is valid for every real number <m>x</m>.  The Ratio Test can be used to show that multiplying every term of a Taylor series by the same power of <m>x</m> does not change the set of <m>x</m>-values for which the series converges, so the Taylor series for <m>g(x)</m> also converges for every value of <m>x</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="act-8a-5-1">Activity</xref>, we find several Taylor series using similar techniques to our approach for <m>x^4 \cos(x^3)</m> above.

      Differentiating and integrating Taylor series
    </title>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="sec-5-6-num-int">Section</xref>, we discussed the challenge posed by the definite integral
      <me>
        \int_0^1 e^{-x^2} \, dx
      </me>.
      Because we are unable to find a simple algebraic antiderivative for the function <m>e^{-x^2}</m>, we cannot use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate the integral exactly.  An alternate approach is to estimate the integral using an effective numerical approximation technique such as Simpson's Rule.         
    </p>

    <p>
      Our recent work with Taylor series now suggests another way to evaluate <m>\int_0^1 e^{-x^2} \, dx</m>, and this approach also provides new options for finding additional Taylor series.  In <xref ref="act-8a-5-1">Activity</xref>, we found that
      <men xml:id="eq-8a-5-ex2">
        e^{-x^2} = 1 - x^2 + \frac{1}{2!}x^4 - \frac{1}{3!}x^6 + \cdots + (-1)^n \frac{1}{n!} x^{2n} + \cdots
      </men>
      and that this representation of <m>e^{-x^2}</m> is valid for every value of <m>x</m>.  This infinite series representation naturally suggests that we could find an antiderivative of <m>e^{-x^2}</m> by integrating both sides of <xref ref="eq-8a-5-ex2">Equation</xref>.  Doing so, we see
      <md>
        <mrow>\int e^{-x^2} \, dx =\mathstrut \amp \int \left( 1 - x^2 + \frac{1}{2!}x^4 - \frac{1}{3!}x^6 + \cdots + (-1)^n \frac{1}{n!} x^{2n} + \cdots \right) \, dx</mrow>
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp C + x - \frac{1}{3}x^3 + \frac{1}{5 \cdot 2!} x^5 - \frac{1}{7 \cdot 3!}x^7 + \cdots + (-1)^n \frac{1}{(2n+1) \cdot n!} x^{2n+1} + \cdots</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      It is not immediately apparent how integrating a Taylor series might change the values of <m>x</m> for which the series converges.  It turns out that both differentiating and integrating a power series has almost no effect<fn>It is possible for the convergence status at the endpoints of the interval to change, but we are normally not concerned with those specific <m>x</m>-values.</fn> on where the series converges, as stated in a result from advanced calculus, The Power Series Differentiation and Integration Theorem.
    </p>

      <title>The Power Series Differentiation and Integration Theorem</title>
      <p>
        If <m>f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_k (x-a)^k</m> converges for <m>|x-a| \lt R</m> for a positive real number <m>R</m>, then
        <me>
          f'(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} k \cdot c_k (x-a)^{k-1}
        </me>
        and 
        <me>
          \int f(x) \, dx = C + \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{c_k}{k+1} (x-a)^{k+1}
        </me>
        and both of these series converge for <m>|x-a| \lt R</m>.
