  <introduction>
    <p>
      So far, we have focused our attention on a small number of functions and their Taylor series centered at <m>a = 0</m>: <m>\frac{1}{1-x}</m>, <m>\ln(1+x)</m>, <m>\sin(x)</m>, <m>\cos(x)</m>, and <m>e^x</m>.  One of the reasons we were able to find these Taylor series is that clear patterns arise in the derivatives of each of these functions.  While we can always use <xref ref="D-8a-4-Taylor-series">Definition</xref> to find the first few terms of a Taylor series, finding a pattern among the various derivatives is challenging for most functions.  In <xref ref="PA-8a-5">Preview Activity</xref>, we explore this issue and investigate a different approach to finding the Taylor series of the function.
