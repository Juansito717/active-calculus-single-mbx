  <introduction>
    <p>
      So far, we have focused our attention on a small collection of basic functions functions <mdash/> <m>\frac{1}{1-x}</m>, <m>\ln(1+x)</m>, <m>\sin(x)</m>, <m>\cos(x)</m>, and <m>e^x</m> <mdash/> and their Taylor series centered at <m>a = 0</m>.  One of the reasons we were able to find these Taylor series is the clear patterns in the derivatives of each of these functions.  While we can always use <xref ref="D-8a-4-Taylor-series">Definition</xref> to find the first few terms of a Taylor series, finding a pattern among the various derivatives is challenging for most functions.  In <xref ref="PA-8a-5">Preview Activity</xref>, we explore this issue and investigate a different approach to finding the Taylor series of the function. 
    </p>

  </introduction>  

  <subsection>
    <title>Using substitution and algebra to find new Taylor series expressions</title>
    <p>
      The substitution technique we used in <xref ref="PA-8a-5">Preview Activity</xref> can be used to find the Taylor series for any function whose structure is similar to that of a Taylor series we already know.  
    </p>

    <example xml:id="ex-8a-5-cosx3">
      <statement>
        Find the Taylor series expansion for <m>g(x) = x^4 \cdot \cos(x^3)</m> and determine the <m>x</m>-values for which the series converges.
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Because <m>\cos(x^3)</m> is part of the function whose Taylor series we seek, we start with the familiar series for <m>\cos(x)</m>.  We know that 
          <men xml:id="eq-8a-5-cosu">
            f(u) = \cos(u) = 1 - \frac{1}{2!}u^2 + \frac{1}{4!}u^4 - \cdots + (-1)^n \frac{1}{(2n)!} u^{2n} + \cdots
          </men>
          for all real numbers <m>u</m>. 
        </p>

        <p>
          By letting <m>u = x^3</m> in <xref ref="eq-8a-5-cosu">Equation</xref>, it follows that
          <me>
            \cos(x^3) = 1 - \frac{1}{2!}(x^3)^2 + \frac{1}{4!}(x^3)^4 - \cdots + (-1)^n \frac{1}{(2n)!} (x^3)^{2n} + \cdots
          </me>, 
          or
          <men xml:id="eq-8a-5-cosx3">
            \cos(x^3) = 1 - \frac{1}{2!}x^6 + \frac{1}{4!}x^{12} - \cdots + (-1)^n \frac{1}{(2n)!} x^{6n} + \cdots
          </men>.      
          Then, multiplying both sides of <xref ref="eq-8a-5-cosx3">Equation</xref> by <m>x^4</m>, we find that 
          <me>
            g(x) = x^4 \cos(x^3) = x^4 - \frac{1}{2!}x^{10} + \frac{1}{4!}x^{16} - \cdots + (-1)^n \frac{1}{(2n)!} x^{6n+4} + \cdots
          </me>.
          Since <xref ref="eq-8a-5-cosu">Equation</xref> is valid for every real number <m>u</m>, letting <m>u = x^3</m> tells us that <xref ref="eq-8a-5-cosx3">Equation</xref> is valid for every real number <m>x</m>.  The Ratio Test can be used to show that multiplying every term of a Taylor series by the same power of <m>x</m> does not change the set of <m>x</m>-values for which the series converges, so the Taylor series for <m>g(x)</m> also converges for every value of <m>x</m>.
        </p>          
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      Because the approach in <xref ref="PA-8a-5">Preview Activity</xref> and <xref ref="ex-8a-5-cosx3">Example</xref> each require us to use a known Taylor series, we restate the Taylor series we've established so far for <m>5</m> important functions in <xref ref="T-8a-5-big-5-redux">Table</xref>.

      In <xref ref="act-8a-5-1">Activity</xref>, we find several Taylor series using substitution and algebraic techniques.

    <title>
      Differentiating and integrating Taylor series
    </title>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="sec-5-6-num-int">Section</xref>, we discussed the challenge posed by the definite integral
      <me>
        \int_0^1 e^{-x^2} \, dx
      </me>.
      Because we are unable to find a simple algebraic antiderivative for the function <m>e^{-x^2}</m>, we cannot use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate the integral exactly.  One approach is to estimate the integral using an effective numerical approximation technique such as Simpson's Rule.         
    </p>

    <p>
      Our recent work with Taylor series now suggests another way to evaluate <m>\int_0^1 e^{-x^2} \, dx</m>, and this approach also provides new options for finding additional Taylor series.  In <xref ref="act-8a-5-1">Activity</xref>, we found that
      <men xml:id="eq-8a-5-ex2">
        e^{-x^2} = 1 - x^2 + \frac{1}{2!}x^4 - \frac{1}{3!}x^6 + \cdots + (-1)^n \frac{1}{n!} x^{2n} + \cdots
      </men>
      and that this representation of <m>e^{-x^2}</m> is valid for every value of <m>x</m>.  This infinite series representation naturally suggests that we could find an antiderivative of <m>e^{-x^2}</m> by integrating both sides of <xref ref="eq-8a-5-ex2">Equation</xref>.  Doing so, we see
      <md>
        <mrow>\int e^{-x^2} \, dx =\mathstrut \amp \int \left( 1 - x^2 + \frac{1}{2!}x^4 - \frac{1}{3!}x^6 + \cdots + (-1)^n \frac{1}{n!} x^{2n} + \cdots \right) \, dx</mrow>
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp C + x - \frac{1}{3}x^3 + \frac{1}{5 \cdot 2!} x^5 - \frac{1}{7 \cdot 3!}x^7 + \cdots + (-1)^n \frac{1}{(2n+1) \cdot n!} x^{2n+1} + \cdots</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      We might wonder how integrating a Taylor series changes the values of <m>x</m> for which the series converges.  It turns out that integrating a power series has almost no effect<fn>It is possible for the convergence status at the endpoints of the interval to change, but we are normally not concerned with those specific <m>x</m>-values.</fn> on where the series converges (nor does differentiating such a series), as stated in a result from advanced calculus, The Power Series Differentiation and Integration Theorem.
    </p>

    <assemblage>
      <title>The Power Series Differentiation and Integration Theorem</title>
      <p>
        If <m>f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_k (x-a)^k</m> converges for <m>|x-a| \lt R</m> for a positive real number <m>R</m>, then
        <me>
          f'(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} k \cdot c_k (x-a)^{k-1}
        </me>
        and 
        <me>
          \int f(x) \, dx = C + \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{c_k}{k+1} (x-a)^{k+1}
        </me>
        and both of these series converge if <m>|x-a| \lt R</m>.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p>
      The Power Series Differentiation and Integration Theorem tells us that when it comes to taking a derivative or antiderivative, we can treat infinite Taylor series almost as if they were finite polynomials:  we can differentiate or integrate a Taylor series term-wise following the Power Rule for differentiating or integrating <m>x^n</m>.  This fact enables us to find many more Taylor series of interesting functions.

      Alternating series
    </title>

    <p>
      Recall that if <m>\lim_{k \to \infty} a_k \neq 0</m>,
      then the series <m>\sum a_k</m> diverges by the Divergence Test.
      From this point forward, we will thus only consider alternating series
      <me>
        \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k+1} a_k
      </me>
      in which the sequence <m>a_k</m> consists of positive numbers that decrease to <m>0</m>.
      The <m>n</m>th partial sum <m>S_n</m> is
      <me>
        S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k+1} a_k
      </me>.

          <p>
            <m>S_2 = a_1 - a_2</m>,

        <li>

        This pattern continues as illustrated in <xref ref="Fig-8-4-Alternating-Series-Test">Figure</xref>
        (with <m>n</m> odd)
        so that each partial sum lies between the previous two partial sums.

      Note further that the absolute value of the difference between the <m>(n-1)</m>st partial sum <m>S_{n-1}</m> and the <m>n</m>th partial sum <m>S_n</m> is

    </p>

    <p>
      Because the sequence <m>\{a_n\}</m> converges to <m>0</m>,
      the distance between successive partial sums becomes as close to zero as we'd like,
      and thus the sequence of partial sums converges
      (even though we don't know the exact value to which it converges).
    </p>

    <p>
      The preceding discussion has demonstrated the truth of the Alternating Series Test.
          <idx><h>alternating series test</h></idx>
    </p>

    <assemblage>
      <title>The Alternating Series Test</title>
      <p>
        Given an alternating series
        <m>
        \sum (-1)^k a_k
        </m>,
        if the sequence <m>\{a_k\}</m> of positive terms decreases to 0 as <m>k \to \infty</m>,
        then the alternating series converges.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p>
      Note that if the limit of the sequence <m>\{a_k\}</m> is not 0, then the alternating series diverges.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the series converges,
      the argument for the Alternating Series Test also provides us with a method to determine how close the <m>n</m>th partial sum <m>S_n</m> is to the actual sum of the series.
      To see how this works,
      let <m>S</m> be the sum of a convergent alternating series, so
      <me>
        S = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^k a_k
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recall that the sequence of partial sums oscillates around the sum <m>S</m> so that
      <me>
        \left|S - S_n \right| \lt  \left| S_{n+1} - S_n \right| = a_{n+1}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore, the value of the term <m>a_{n+1}</m> provides an error estimate for how well the partial sum <m>S_n</m> approximates the actual sum <m>S</m>.
      We summarize this fact in the statement of the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem.
          <idx><h>alternating series estimation theorem</h></idx>

    <assemblage>
      <title>Alternating Series Estimation Theorem</title>

        If the alternating series
        <m>
        \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k+1}a_k
        </m>
        has positive terms <m>a_k</m> that decrease to zero as <m>k \to \infty</m>, and

        S_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} (-1)^{k+1}a_k

          <me>
            \left| S_{100} - S \right| \lt  a_{101}

          so the 100th partial sum is within 0.0099 of the sum of the series.
          We have discussed the fact
          (and will later verify)
          that

        <p>
          We see that the actual difference between <m>S</m> and <m>S_{100}</m> is approximately <m>0.0049750013</m>,
