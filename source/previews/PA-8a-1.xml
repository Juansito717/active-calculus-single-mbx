    Consider the function <m>f(x) = e^x</m> near <m>a = 0</m>.  We know that <m>f’(x) = e^x</m>, so <m>f’(0) = 1</m>; along with the fact that <m>f(0) = 1</m>, it follows that the tangent line approximation is <m>L(x) = f(0) + f’(0)(x-0) = 1 + 1(x-0) = 1 + x</m>.

          Build a spreadsheet that computes the difference between <m>f(x)</m> and <m>L(x)</m> for <m>x</m>-values between <m>-1</m> and <m>1</m>, spaced <m>0.1</m> units apart.  Your spreadsheet should start like the one shown in <xref ref="T-8a-1-PA-linear-approx">Table</xref>.

      <li>
        <p>
          Next, add a column to your spreadsheet that computes <m>|f(x)-L(x)|</m>. 
        </p> 
        <p>
          How do the differences between <m>f(x)</m> and <m>L(x)</m> change as you move across the interval from <m>x = -1</m> to <m>x = 1</m>?

      <li>
        <p>
          For about what values of <m>x</m> is it true that <m>|f(x)-L(x)| \lt 0.1</m>?

      <li>
        <p>
          Next, to investigate the possibility of a better approximation than the tangent line, we consider the quadratic function <m>Q(x) = 1 + x + \frac{1}{2}x^2</m>.  Add two columns in your spreadsheet to the right of your existing columns: one that computes <m>Q(x)</m>, and another that computes <m>|f(x)-Q(x)|</m>.  How do the differences between <m>f(x)</m> and <m>Q(x)</m> change as you move across the interval from <m>x = -1</m> to <m>x = 1</m>?

      <li>

          For about what values of <m>x</m> is it true that <m>|f(x)-Q(x)| \lt 0.1</m>?
