  <introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="act-8a-1-2">Activity</xref>, we investigated a degree <m>3</m> polynomial approximation <m>T(x)</m> to <m>f(x) = e^x</m> near <m>a = 0</m>.  To do so, we chose the conditions <m>T(0) = f(0)</m>, <m>T'(0) = f'(0)</m>, <m>T''(0) = f''(0)</m>, and <m>T'''(0) = f'''(0)</m>.  Starting with <m>T(x) = k_0 + k_1 x + k_2 x^2 + k^3 x^3</m> and <m>f(x) = e^x</m> and finding the needed derivatives and evaluating them at <m>a = 0</m> led us to the results in <xref ref="T-8a-2-intro">Table</xref>

      Equating the function and derivative values of <m>f</m> and <m>T</m> at <m>a = 0</m>, we found that
      <me>k_0 = 1, k_1 = 1, 2k_2 = 1, 6k_3 = 1</me>
      and therefore
      <me>k_0 = 1, k_1 = 1, k_2 = \frac{1}{2}, k_3 = \frac{1}{6}</me>
      so that <me>T(x) = 1 + x + \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{6}x^3</me>.  Moreover, plotting <m>f</m> and <m>T</m> near <m>a = 0</m>, we see in the <xref ref="F-8a-2-intro">Figure</xref> that the interval of accuracy for a tolerance of <m>0.1</m> is about <m>-1.2 \le x \le 1.2</m>.

      More precisely, we might compute that <m>|f(-1.16) - T(-1.16)| \approx 0.0608</m> and <m>|f(1.16) - T(1.16)| \approx 0.0970</m>, which helps us see the degree <m>3</m> approximation is very accurate on an interval wider than <m>|x| \lt 1</m>.

      In this section, we will learn how we can find higher degree approximations for functions other than <m>f(x) = e^x</m>, as well as how to center the approximation at a value other than <m>a = 0</m>.

  <subsection>
    <title>Taylor polynomials</title>
    <p>
      In our work so far in <xref ref="C-8a">Chapter</xref>, we have found several different approximations of two important functions: <m>e^x</m> and <m>\sin(x)</m>.  In <xref ref="sec-8a-1-linear-poly">Section</xref>, we saw that near <m>a = 0</m>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>e^x \approx 1 + x</m> (the degree <m>1</m> approximation);
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>e^x \approx 1 + x + \frac{1}{2}x^2</m> (the degree <m>2</m> approximation);  and
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>e^x \approx 1 + x + \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{6}x^3</m> (the degree <m>3</m> approximation).
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      Moreover, we found that as the degree of the approximation increased, the polynomial approximation got more accurate by being closer to the <m>e^x</m> on a wider interval.
    </p>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="PA-8a-2">Preview</xref>, we saw further that 
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\sin(x) \approx x</m> (the degree <m>1</m> approximation); and
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\sin(x) \approx x - \frac{1}{6}x^3</m> (the degree <m>3</m> approximation).
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      We can also notice that the linear approximation is embedded within the quadratic approximation, and the quadratic approximation within the cubic one, and so on.  These observations naturally lead us to consider approximations of arbitrary degree <m>n</m> in order to generate more accurate approximations for any function with a sufficient number of derivatives.  We thus define the <term>Taylor polynomial of degree <m>n</m> centered at <m>a = 0</m></term> as follows.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-Taylor-poly-0">
      <statement>
         Let <m>n</m> be a natural number and let <m>f</m> be a function with at least <m>n</m> derivatives at <m>a = 0</m>.  The <term>degree <m>n</m> Taylor polynomial of <m>f</m> centered at <m>a = 0</m></term> is the function
         <me>T_n(x) = c_0 + c_1x + c_2x^2 + \cdots + c_nx^n</me>
         that satisfies
         <m>T_n(0) = f(0)</m>, <m>T_n’(0) = f’(0)</m>, <m>T_n’’(0) = f’’(0)</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>T_n^{(n)}(0) = f^{(n)}(0)</m>.
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      By definition, <m>T_n</m> is the polynomial whose function and first <m>n</m> derivative values at <m>a = 0</m> match the function value and all <m>n</m> derivative values of <m>f</m> at <m>a = 0</m>.  
    </p>

    <p>
      The <m>n+1</m> equations <m>T_n(0) = f(0)</m>, <m>T_n’(0) = f’(0)</m>, <m>T_n’’(0) = f’’(0)</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>T_n^{(n)}(0) = f^{(n)}(0)</m> enable us to determine the coefficients <m>c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_n</m> in terms of the values of the various derivatives of <m>f</m>.  Indeed, by taking the various derivatives of <m>T_n(x)</m>, evaluating those derivatives at <m>a = 0</m>, and setting each result equal to the corresponding derivative value of <m>f</m>, we see the results in the <xref ref="T-8a-2-Taylor-0">Table</xref>.

    <p>
      We see the pattern that for each derivative we take, each coefficient <m>c_i</m> gets multiplied by what was formerly the corresponding power to which <m>x</m> was raised.  For example, the repeated derivatives of <m>x^4</m> are <m>4x^3</m>, <m>4 \cdot 3 x^2</m>, <m>4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 x</m>, and finally <m>4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1</m>.  By the time we get to the fourth derivative of <m>x^4</m>, only a constant remains, and that constant is the factorial<fn>For any positive whole number <m>n</m>, its factorial, <m>n!</m> is the product of all of the positive whole numbers less than or equal to <m>n</m>: <m>n! = n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot \cdots \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1</m>.</fn> 
      <me>
        \frac{d^4}{dx^4}\left[ x^4 \right] = 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 4!
      </me>
      From the rightmost column of <xref ref="T-8a-2-Taylor-0">Table</xref>, we now see how the values of <m>c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_n</m> are determined by the values of <m>f</m> and its derivatives evaluated at <m>a = 0</m>, scaled by corresponding factorials.  In particular, 
      <me>
        c_0 = f(0), c_1 = f’(0), c_2 = \frac{f’’(0)}{2!}, c_3 = \frac{f’’’(0)}{3!}, c_4 = \frac{f^{(4)}(0)}{4!}, \ldots, c_n = \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}
      </me>
      This enables us to find the Taylor polynomial of degree <m>n</m> for any function <m>f</m> by computing the polynomial's coefficients via finding the values of <m>f(0), f'(0), \ldots, f^{(n)}(0)</m>.

        <p>
          When finding the coefficients of a Taylor polynomial, it is often helpful to <em>not</em> combine into a single number products such as <m>(-3)(-2)(-1)</m> and <m>(-4)(-3)(-2)(-1)</m> in order to better observe patterns; indeed, by not combining the constants that arise in higher derivatives of <m>f(x) = \ln(1+x)</m>, we see a pattern of alternating signs, as well as factorials that arise.  From the right column of <xref ref="T-8a-2-Taylor-example">Table</xref> and the fact that <m>c_k = \frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}</m>, we see that
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>c_0 = 0</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>c_1 = 1</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>c_2 = \frac{-1}{2!} = -\frac{1}{2}</m>
              </p>
            </li>            
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>c_3 = \frac{(-2)(-1)}{3!} = \frac{1}{3}</m>
              </p>
            </li> 
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>c_4 = \frac{(-3)(-2)(-1)}{4!} = -\frac{1}{4}</m>
              </p>
            </li> 
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>c_5 = \frac{(-4)(-3)(-2)(-1)}{5!} = \frac{1}{5}</m>
              </p>
            </li> 
          </ul>
          so that the degree <m>5</m> Taylor approximation of <m>f(x) = \ln(1+x)</m> at <m>a = 0</m> is
          <me>
            T_5(x) = 1x - \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{1}{4}x^4 + \frac{1}{5}x^5.
          </me>
        </p>        
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      From our work in <xref ref="Ex-8a-2-Taylor-example">Example</xref>, we can also see a pattern that arises and thus we expect the general degree <m>n</m> Taylor polynomial centered at <m>a = 0</m> for <m>f(x) = \ln(1+x)</m> to be
      <me>
        T_n(x) = x - \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \cdots + (-1)^{n-1}\frac{1}{n}x^n.
      </me>
      For many familiar functions, a pattern emerges in their derivatives that enables us to find the general form of the degree <n>n</n> Taylor polynomial.
    </p>

    <xi:include href="./activities/act-8a-2-1.xml" />

    <p>
      In <xref ref="act-8a-2-1">Activity</xref>, we see that the degree <m>6</m> Taylor approximation of the cosine function at <m>a = 0</m> is
      <me>
        \cos(x) \approx 1 - \frac{1}{2!}x^2 + \frac{1}{4!}x^4 - \frac{1}{6!}x^6. 
      </me>
      We can do similar work to extend what we found in <xref ref="PA-8a-2">Preview Activity</xref> and observe that
      <me>
        \sin(x) \approx x - \frac{1}{3!}x^3 + \frac{1}{5!}x^5 - \frac{1}{7!}x^7
      </me>
      is the degree <m>7</m> Taylor approximation of the sine function at <m>a = 0</m>.  Furthermore, as we saw in <xref ref="sec-8a-1-linear-poly">Section</xref>, 
      <me>
        e^x \approx 1 + x + \frac{1}{2!}x^2 + \frac{1}{3!}x^3 + \frac{1}{4!}x^4
      </me>
      so we now have higher degree Taylor approximations for <m>e^x</m>, <m>\sin(x)</m>, and <m>\cos(x)</m> that exhibit interesting patterns in their coefficients.  We will explore these further in **Section**.

    <title>
      Taylor polynomial approximations centered at an arbitrary value <m>a</m>
    </title>

    <p>
      In all of our work so far in <xref ref="C-8a">Chapter</xref>, we have focused on approximating functions such as <m>f(x) = e^x</m>, <m>f(x) = \sin(x)</m>, <m>f(x) = \ln(1+x)</m>, and <m>f(x) = \cos(x)</m> near <m>a = 0</m>.  But we could instead be interested in the behavior of some function <m>f</m> near <m>a = 5</m>, or be interested in a function <m>f</m> that wasn't even defined at <m>a = 0</m>, so next we consider how we can generalize our earlier work to Taylor polynomial approximations at any value <m>a</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      From our early studies in <xref ref="sec-1-8-tan-line-approx">Section</xref>, we know that at any input value <m>x = a</m> where a function <m>f</m> has a first derivative, <m>f</m> has a tangent line approximation 
      <me>L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)</me>
      that satisfies <m>f(x) \approx L(x)</m> for <m>x</m> values near <m>a</m>.  Provided that <m>f</m> has a second derivative at <m>x=a</m>, we can generate a quadratic approximation near <m>a</m> for <m>f</m> like we found at <m>a = 0</m> for <m>f(x)=e^x</m> in <xref ref="act-8a-1-2">Activity</xref>, and as long as <m>f</m> has a third derivative at <m>x=a</m>, we can even find a cubic approximation (as in <xref ref="act-8a-1-3">Activity</xref>).  In developing such an approximation, our guiding principle is the same as with our work at <m>a = 0</m>: we'll require that at the input value <m>a</m>, the original function's output and its derivatives' outputs match the corresponding approximation's output and derivatives' output.
    </p>

    <p>
      Building on the form of the tangent line approximation, <m>L(x) = f(a) + f’(a)(x-a)</m>, it is natural for us to consider a quadratic approximation of form <m>T_2(x) = c_0 + c_1(x-a) + c_2 (x-a)^2</m>, and a cubic approximation of form <m>T_3(x) = c_0 + c_1 (x-a) + c_2 (x-a)^2 + c_3(x-a)^3</m>, and so on.  Indeed, we define the degree <m>n</m> Taylor Polynomial centered at <m>a</m> more generally as follows.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-Taylor-poly-a">
      <statement>
         Let <m>n</m> be a natural number and let <m>f</m> be a function with at least <m>n</m> derivatives at <m>a</m>.  The <term>degree <m>n</m> Taylor polynomial of <m>f</m> centered at <m>a</m></term> is the function
         <me>T_n(x) = c_0 + c_1(x-a) + c_2(x-a)^2 + \cdots + c_n(x-a)^n</me>
         that satisfies
         <m>T_n(a) = f(a)</m>, <m>T_n’(a) = f’(a)</m>, <m>T_n’’(a) = f’’(a)</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>T_n^{(n)}(a) = f^{(n)}(a)</m>.
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      Similar to the situation when <m>a = 0</m>, it follows that we can find the coefficients <m>c_k</m> of the Taylor polynomial in terms of the various derivatives of <m>f</m> evaluated at <m>a</m>.  
    </p>

      <title>Finding the degree <m>n</m> Taylor polynomial of <m>f</m> centered at <m>a</m></title>

          Provided that a function <m>f(x)</m> has <m>n</m> derivatives at a selected input value <m>x = a</m>, we can find a degree <m>n</m> polynomial <m>T_n(x)</m> that approximates <m>f(x)</m> near <m>a</m> by requiring that <m>T_n(a) = f(a)</m>, <m>T_n'(a) = f'(a)</m>, <m>T_n''(a) = f''(a)</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>T_n^{(n)}(a) = f^{(n)}(a)</m>.

      <li>  
        <p>
          When <m>a = 0</m>, we call the degree <m>n</m> polynomial approximation, <m>T_n(x)</m> to a function <m>f(x)</m> near <m>0</m> the <q>degree <m>n</m> Taylor polynomial of <m>f</m> centered at <m>a = 0</m></q>, and if we write 
          <me>T_n(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + \cdots c_n x^n</me>
          it follows that the coefficients <m>c_k</m> are determined by the values of the various derivatives of <m>f(x)</m> evaluated at <m>0</m> according to the formula
          <me>c_k = \frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}.</me>

        <p>
          Just as we can consider any function <m>f</m> that has <m>n</m> derivatives, we can also consider any input value <m>a</m> at which those <m>n</m> derivatives exist, and find a polynomial approximation that satisfies <m>T_n(a) = f(a)</m>, <m>T_n'(a) = f'(a)</m>, <m>T_n''(a) = f''(a)</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>T_n^{(n)}(a) = f^{(n)}(a)</m>.  We call the degree <m>n</m> polynomial approximation, <m>T_n(x)</m> to the function <m>f(x)</m> near <m>a</m> the <q>degree <m>n</m> Taylor polynomial of <m>f</m> centered at <m>a</m></q>, and if we write

          it follows that the coefficients <m>c_k</m> are determined by the values of the various derivatives of <m>f(x)</m> evaluated at <m>a</m> according to the formula
